//! Functions produced by the Flock API often hold state in various forms:
//!
//! - Windows gather elements or aggregates until they are triggered;
//! - Transformation functions may use the key/value state interface to store
//!   values;
//! - Transformation functions may implement the CheckpointedFunction interface
//!   to make their local variables fault tolerant;
//!
//! When checkpointing is activated, such state is persisted upon checkpoints to
//! guard against data loss and recover consistently. How the state is
//! represented internally, and how and where it is persisted upon checkpoints
//! depends on the chosen State Backend.
//!
//! Out of the box, Flock bundles these state backends:
//!
//! - `HashMapStateBackend`: holds data internally as objects in the function's
//!   global memory. Key/value state and window operators hold hash tables that
//!   store the values, triggers, etc. This backend does not provide any
//!   guarantees on fault tolerance. This backend is always available, which
//!   doesn't need to be specified.
//!
//! - `S3StateBackend`: holds in-flight data in AWS S3 buckets. Unlike the Arena
//!   backend, data is stored as serialized byte arrays, or CSV files or Parquet
//!   files. This backend provides fault tolerance.
//!
//! - `EfsStateBackend`: holds in-flight data in Amazon Elastic File System
//!   (EFS). Unlike the Arena backend, data is stored as serialized byte arrays,
//!   or CSV files or Parquet files. This backend provides fault tolerance.
//!
//! If nothing else is configured, the system will use the HashMapStateBackend.
//!
//! Note that S3StateBackend and EfsStateBackend allow keeping very large state,
//! compared to the HashMapStateBackend that keeps state in memory. This also
//! means, however, that the maximum throughput that can be achieved will be
//! lower with this state backend. All reads/writes from/to this backend have to
//! go through de-/serialization to retrieve/store the state objects, which is
//! also more expensive than always working with the in-memory representation as
//! the memory-based backends are doing.
//!
//! When deciding between state backends, it is a choice between performance,
//! scalability and fault tolerance. HashMapStateBackend is very fast as each
//! state access and update operates on objects in the memory; however, state
//! size is limited by available memory in the functions. On the other hand,
//! EFS and S3 can scale several orders of magnitude better than it. However,
//! each state access and update requires (de-)serialization and potentially
//! reading from remote SSD which leads to average performance that is an order
//! of magnitude slower than the memory state backends.
