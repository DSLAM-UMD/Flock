//! The helper crate for cloud function to extract information from a physical
//! plan.
//!
//! A generic execution plan which includes:
//! - `CoalesceBatchesExec`: Combines small batches into larger batches for more
//!   efficient use of vectorized processing by upstream operators.
//! - `CsvExec`: Execution plan for scanning a CSV file.
//! - `DummyExec`: Dummy execution plan.
//! - `EmptyExec`: Execution plan for empty relation (produces no rows).
//! - `ExplainExec`: Explain execution plan operator. This operator contains the
//!   string values of the various plans it has when it is created, and passes
//!   them to its output.
//! - `FilterExec`: Evaluates a boolean predicate against all input batches to
//!   determine which rows to include in its output batches.
//! - `HashAggregateExec`: Hash aggregate execution plan.
//! - `HashJoinExec`: Join execution plan executes partitions in parallel and
//!   combines them into a set of partitions.
//! - `GlobalLimitExec`: Limit execution plan.
//! - `LocalLimitExec`: Applies a limit to a single partition.
//! - `MemoryExec`: Execution plan for reading in-memory batches of data.
//! - `Merge`: Execution plan executes partitions in parallel and combines them
//!   into a single partition. No guarantees are made about the order of the
//!   resulting partition.
//! - `ParquetExec`: Execution plan for scanning one or more `Parquet`
//!   partitions.
//! - `ProjectionExec`: Execution plan for a projection.
//! - `RepartitionExec`: The repartition operator maps N input partitions to M
//!   output partitions based on a partitioning scheme. No guarantees are made
//!   about the order of the resulting partitions.
//! - `Sort`: The sort execution plan.
