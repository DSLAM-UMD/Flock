@section{What is Nexmark}

Nexmark is a benchmark suite for queries over continuous data streams. This benchmark is inspired by 
the @link["https://web.archive.org/web/20100620010601/http://datalab.cs.pdx.edu/niagaraST/NEXMark/"]{NEXMark research paper} and Apache Beam.

These are multiple queries over a three entities model representing on online auction system:

@itemlist[
  @item{@bold{Person} represents a person submitting an item for auction and/or making a bid on an auction.}
  @item{@bold{Auction} represents an item under auction.}
  @item{@bold{Bid} represents a bid for an item under auction.}
]

@section{The Queries}

@tabular[#:style 'boxed 
         #:row-properties '(bottom-border ())
         #:sep @hspace[2]
	 (list* (list @bold{Nexmark Benchmark Suite} 'cont 'cont)
	        (list @elem{@bold{Query}} @elem{@bold{Name}} @elem{@bold{Summary}})
            (list 
            (list "q0"	"Pass Through"	"Measures the monitoring overhead including the source generator.")
            (list "q1"	"Currency Conversion"	"Convert each bid value from dollars to euros.")
            (list "q2"	"Selection"	"Find bids with specific auction ids and show their bid price.")
            (list "q3"	"Local Item Suggestion"	"Who is selling in OR, ID or CA in category 10, and for what auction ids?")
            (list "q4"	"Average Price for a Category"	"Select the average of the wining bid prices for all auctions in each category.")
            (list "q5"	"Hot Items"	"Which auctions have seen the most bids in the last period?")
            (list "q6"	"Average Selling Price by Seller"	"What is the average selling price per seller for their last 10 closed auctions.")
            (list "q7"	"Highest Bid"	"Select the bids with the highest bid price in the last period.")
            (list "q8"	"Monitor New Users"	"Select people who have entered the system and created auctions in the last period.")
            (list "q9"	"Winning Bids"	"Find the winning bid for each auction.")
            (list "q10"	"Log to File System"	"Log all events to file system. Illustrates windows streaming data into partitioned file system.")
            (list "q11"	"User Sessions"	"How many bids did a user make in each session they were active? Illustrates session windows.")
            (list "q12"	"Processing Time Windows"	"How many bids does a user make within a fixed processing time limit? Illustrates working in processing time window.")
            (list "q13"	"Bounded Side Input Join"	"Joins a stream to a bounded side input, modeling basic stream enrichment.")

            ))]

@emph{q1 ~ q8 are from original NEXMark queries, q9 ~ q13 are from Apache Beam.}

@section{Benchmark Guideline}

The Nexmark benchmark framework runs Flink queries on standalone cluster (Session Mode). The cluster should consist of 
one master node and one or more worker nodes. All of them should be Linux environment (the CPU monitor script requries to 
run on Linux). Please make sure you have the following software installed on each node:

@itemlist[#:style 'unnumbered
    @item{JDK 1.8.x or higher (Nexmark scripts uses some tools of JDK)}
    @item{ssh (sshd must be running to use the Flink and Nexmark scripts that manage remote components)}
]

Having @link["https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/"](passwordless SSH) and the same directory structure 
on all your cluster nodes will allow you to use our scripts to control everything.

@subsection{Build Nexmark}

Before start to run the benchmark, you should build the Nexmark benchmark first to have a benchmark package. 
Please make sure you have installed maven in your build machine. And run the emph{./build.sh} command under nexmark-flink directoy. 
Then you will get the nexmark-flink.tgz archive under the directory.

@bash-repl{
$ git clone https://github.com/nexmark/nexmark
$ cd nexmark-flink
[nexmark-flink ~] mvn package -DskipTests
[nexmark-flink ~] ls target/
nexmark-flink-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar  original-nexmark-flink-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
[nexmark-flink ~] ls
build.sh*  nexmark-flink.tgz  pom.xml  src/  target/
}
