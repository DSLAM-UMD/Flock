## Playground

Playground module for testing and experimenting with the library. It is not meant to be used in production.
We writes many simplifed examples to evaluate the system design and implementation of Flock.

```shell
[06:32] umd-db.cs.umd.edu:release (code *%) | ./playground --help
flock-playground 0.1.0

USAGE:
    playground [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --concurrency <concurrency>    Concurrency of the lambda function [default: 8]
    -e, --events <events>              Number of events generated [default: 1000]
    -o, --ops_type <ops-type>          Operation type [default: scatter_gather_ops]
```

## Scatter and Gather Pattern

This module shows how to implement scatter-gather pattern on AWS Lambda. In this example, the source function (concurrency > 1) is a lambda function that sends data packets to a destination function. The destination function (concurrency = 1) is a lambda function that receives data packets from the source function (instances) and aggregates them. The source function and the destination function (instances) are implemented in the different lambda function.

This module includes two lambda functions:

- `flock_pg_scatter`
- `flock_pg_gather`

The client will sends `N` events to the `flock_pg_scatter` function. The `flock_pg_scatter` function sends the events to the `flock_pg_gather` function. The `flock_pg_gather` function receives the events and sums them up.
The ith event contains a integer value `i + 1` where i starts from 0. For example, the first event contains 1, the second event contains 2, and so on.

If we send 100 events to the `flock_pg_scatter` function, the `flock_pg_gather` function will receive 100 events. The sum of the events is 100 \* 101 / 2 = 5050. If we send 500 events, the sum of the events is 500 \* 501 / 2 = 125250. If we send 800 events, the sum of the events is 800 \* 801 / 2 = 320400.

### Example

**1. Run an experiment with events = 500, concurrency = 32, and ops_type = scatter_gather_ops.**

```text
$ ./playground -e 500 -c 32 -o scatter_gather_ops

Playground with the following options: PlaygroundOpt { ops_type: "scatter_gather_ops", events: 500, concurrency: 32 }
```

**2. Log Events**

The sum of 1 to 500 is **500 \* 501 / 2 = 125250**. Let's parse the logs of the `flock_pg_gather` function, and see what the sum of the events is. In [gather.rs](./scatter_gather_ops/gather.rs), we print the sum of events with UTC time stamp when the function is invoked.

```rust
# gather.rs
println!("{}: {}", Utc::now(), SUM);
```

From the logs, we can see that the sum of the events is **125250**, which means that the sum of the events is correct, and the scatter-gather pattern is working correctly.
