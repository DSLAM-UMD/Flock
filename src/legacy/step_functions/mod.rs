//! Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine
//! AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical
//! applications. Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your
//! applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.
//! https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions
//!
//! Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. A state machine is a
//! workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of
//! work that another AWS service performs. Each step in a workflow is a state.
//!
//! With Step Functions' built-in controls, you examine the state of each step
//! in your workflow to make sure that your application runs in order and as
//! expected. Depending on your use case, you can have Step Functions call AWS
//! services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks. You also can create
//! long-running, automated workflows for applications that require human
//! interaction.
//!
//! Individual states can make decisions based on their input, perform actions,
//! and pass output to other states. In AWS Step Functions you define your
//! workflows in the Amazon States Language (https://states-language.net/). The
//! Step Functions console provides a graphical representation of that state
//! machine to help visualize your application logic.
