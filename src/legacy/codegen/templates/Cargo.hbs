# Cargo defaults its optimization level to 3 for release builds, which optimizes the binary for speed.
# To instruct Cargo to optimize for minimal binary size, use the `z` optimization level in Cargo.toml.
# opt-level = 'z'

# By default, Cargo instructs compilation units to be compiled and optimized in isolation. LTO instructs
# the linker to optimize at the link stage. This can remove dead code and often times reduces binary size.
lto = true

# By default, Cargo specifies 16 parallel codegen units for release builds. This improves compile times,
# but prevents some optimizations. Set this to 1 in to allow for maximum size reduction optimizations.
codegen-units = 1

# By default, when Rust code encounters a situation when it must call panic!(), it unwinds the stack and
# produces a helpful backtrace. The unwinding code, however, does require extra binary size. rustc can be
# instructed to abort immediately rather than unwind, which removes the need for this extra unwinding code.
panic = 'abort'

# By default on Linux and macOS, symbol information is included in the compiled .elf file.
# This information is not needed to properly execute the binary.
